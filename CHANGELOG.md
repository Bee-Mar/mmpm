# MMPM Changelog

## Version 0.1

- Initial creation of MMPM package manager

## Version 0.2

- Some code cleanup

- renamed some function calls to be more idiomatic

- Added doc-strings to functions

- Added new method `check_for_mmpm_enhancements` to check for updates to MMPM, which will run
    intermittently, and prompt the user when one is found

- The user may also run `check_for_mmpm_enhancements` by specifying the `-e` flag

- Removed onus of installing required Python modules on user during `make install` process by
  including `try` and `except` blocks in `mmpm.py`. Primary reason for this was based on odd
  segmentation faults when attempting to handle original `make install` from within
  `check_for_mmpm_enhancements`. This will be cleaned up later on, but since it seems to work, no
  reason to go overboard just yet.

- Still a lot more code cleanup can be done...like A LOT more.

- Planning to break up MMPM into a module, and add functionality which will include scraping of the
  module pages to find any configs that can be placed into the main config, `config.js`
  automatically for the user. This should be pretty doable considering it's just a JSON file, and it
  call be indexed into

- Next version will focus on more code cleanup, and presentation of module names. Rather than
  displaying everything in a large list, they will be shown in a table, that is more compact and
  readable.

## Version 0.25

- Updated `display_modules` to display the output as a formatted table

- Version 0.3 will focus on performance improvements, and code cleanup

  command
